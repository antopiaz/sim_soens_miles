Welcome to **sim_soens**, the *Simulator for Superconducting Optoelectronic Networks*, documentation!
=============================================================================================

Superconducting Optoelectronic Networks (SOENs) are an in-development neuromorphic hardware that offer lightspeed communication and brain-level scalability.
This repo is for the coders, neuroscientists, and machine-learners that want to play with the computational properties of SOENs through simulation based on the phenomological model linked here:
